# Create-Lists-m3u-m3u8 | Dynamic Playlist Manager | Web App
#### Author: Bocaletto Luca

ðŸš€ **Dynamic Playlist Manager Web App** is a PHP-based application that allows you to manage your media playlist easily. With this tool, you can:

- **Add new items** (each with a title and URL) to the playlist.
- **View the playlist** in a table format and have the option to edit or delete every item (using modal dialogs for editing).
- **Import a playlist** from a JSON file.
- **Export your playlist** in various formats: JSON, .m3u, .m3u8, CSV, and SQL.

All data is persistently stored in a JSON file (`playlist_data.json`), which is automatically created if it does not exist.

## Features

- **Add Items:** Easily add new playlist items by entering a title and URL.
- **Edit & Delete:** Modify or remove individual items from your playlist using modal dialogs.
- **Import Playlist:** Paste JSON-formatted data to import an entire playlist.

## How It Works

1. **Add an Item:**  
   Use the form at the top of the page to enter a title and a URL. When you submit the form, the item is added to your playlist with a unique ID (using the current timestamp).

2. **Edit or Delete an Item:**  
   The playlist is displayed in a table. For each item, you can:
   - Click **"Edit"** to open a modal where you can update the title and URL.
   - Click **"Delete"** to remove the item (with a confirmation prompt).

3. **Importing Playlists:**  
   Paste valid JSON data into the import section and submit the form to load a new playlist.

4. **Exporting Playlists:**  
   Use the export links provided to download your playlist in the desired format (JSON, .m3u, .m3u8, CSV, or SQL).
